# CERBERUS Emergency Response

## Inspiration
* 220 active shooter events between 2000-2016 and 1,486 people were either killed or wounded
* Statistics show that the majority of shooters will not stop until they are confronted by law enforcement
* Average active shooter incident lasts 12 minutes or less, and the first calls to 911 do not typically come in for a number of minutes
* No application like it in the market

## What it does

1. Allows users to report the active shooter and request medical assistance using an iOS app with the click of a button 
2. Collects geolocation and audio* from users reporting active shooter to determine the shooting event and active shooter location
3. Facilitates reporting of an active shooting event and increases first responders' response effectiveness
